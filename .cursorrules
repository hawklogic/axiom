# Axiom IDE — Agent Rules
# This file defines behavior for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Identity (Non-Negotiable)
- Product name: **Axiom**
- Steward: **HawkLogic Systems**
- License: Apache-2.0
- Never rename to "HawkLogic Axiom" — Axiom is the instrument, HawkLogic signs the work

## Philosophy Constraints
- No generative AI features
- No cloud services
- No telemetry
- No speculation or probabilistic behavior
- Only reveal ground truth: compiler output, AST, ABI, ISA, debugger state

## Code Standards
- Every source file (.rs, .ts, .svelte, .css) MUST have SPDX header:
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
  // Copyright 2024 HawkLogic Systems
- Run scripts/check_spdx.sh before committing
- Backend before frontend in all workstreams
- No direct commits to main branch
- No force-push

## Context Persistence
- On session start: read .cursor/axiom_agent_state.json and .cursor/context.md
- On workstream completion: update state files, commit, push, merge to dev
- Never ask user to restate intent — resume from next_step field

## Testing Requirements
- All crates must have unit tests
- Integration tests for cross-crate functionality
- GUI smoke tests for UI changes
- No speculative assertions — only verifiable facts

## Toolchain Rules
- Never mutate PATH
- Use explicit paths for all toolchain binaries
- Override precedence: User settings > Bundled > Detected

## Autocomplete Rules
- Tab-triggered only
- Symbol-table + AST driven
- Deterministic alphabetical ordering within kind
- No AI/probabilistic ranking
